            <h2>Medium Cars</h2>
        The Maruti Ertiga has 1 Petrol Engine and 1 CNG Engine on offer. The Petrol engine is 1462 cc while the CNG engine is 1462 cc<br>
        It is available with Automatic & Manual transmission.Depending upon the variant and fuel type the Ertiga has a mileage of 20.3 kmpl to 26.11 km/kg <br>
        The Ertiga is a 7 seater 4 cylinder car and has length of 4395mm, width of 1735 and a wheelbase of 2740.<br>
        The facelifted Ertiga gets a 1.5-litre petrol engine with mild hybrid and DualJet tech<br>
         The petrol unit now makes 103PS and 137Nm (2PS and 1Nm lower than before) which is transferred to the wheels<br>
         using a 5-speed manual as standard, with a new 6-speed torque converter with paddle shifters replacing the 4-speed automatic option.<br>
         The CNG variants of the MPV produce 88PS (4PS lower) and 122Nm with a claimed mileage of 26.11km/kg<br>
         The petrol- manual and automatic counterparts return 20.51km/l and 20.30km/l respectively. <br>
         If you are looking for a tough ladder-frame SUV which is easy to drive in the city and at the same time <br>
         can take on bad roads with ease, the Scorpio-N is certainly a good choice.
